      <h1>My Projects</h1>
      <h2>Time Machine Saga</h2>
      <p>This is the biggest project I have ever worked on. I have poured my heart and soul into the making of this series. This was also the project that inspired Micasddsa's "Storybook" series. </p><p>His website: <a href="https://micasddsa.github.io/">Click Here</a></p><p></p>
      <p>Episodes/Stories are listed as follows.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Diary of a Future Kid (The Refraction Project) - Science? Dragons? Asteroids? Time Travel? We've got it all.</p></li>
        <li><p>The Week of Terror (TWoT) - The End of a Universe. A supposed "Finale."</p></li>
        <li><p>Time Avenue - The sequel to The Week of Terror.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <h2>TMSandbox</h2>
    <p>A testing ground to see how characters canon and noncanon to Time Machine Saga could react to random events.</p>
    <h2>Lucid (Acts 1-4)</h2>
      <p>Lucid is a series of albums of songs. Act 1 was published on January 11, 2023. Act 2 was published recently in March. Act 3 is currently in the making, and Act 4 will be the final release for the series. This will be updated as I keep publishing more songs. Check my soundcloud weekly to stay updated.
